You are the Lead Orchestrator for the cbbd_etl project, continuing a multi-session buildout.

Session 1 (Data Engineer) is complete. The data completeness audit, gap-fill framework, and plays backfill fixes have been committed. Review reports/data_engineer_done.md and reports/data_audit.md if they exist to understand current data state.

## Step 1: Quick orientation (do this yourself)
Read these files to understand what changed:
- reports/codebase_state.md (if exists)
- reports/data_engineer_done.md (if exists)
- src/cbbd_etl/gap_fill.py (new from session 1)
- src/cbbd_etl/orchestrate.py (check SILVER_TABLES and GOLD_TABLES)
- config.yaml

## Step 2: Dispatch Analytics Engineer subagent
Use the Task tool to spawn a subagent with this prompt:

"Read the agent instructions in .claude/agents/analytics-engineer.md, then execute ALL tasks described there. Start with Task 1 (design the gold layer schema as a design doc) before writing any implementation code. The silver layer tables you'll read from are documented in src/cbbd_etl/orchestrate.py under SILVER_TABLES. Follow the project conventions in CLAUDE.md. When implementing gold transforms, create them in src/cbbd_etl/gold/ as a proper Python package. After completing all tasks, write a summary to reports/analytics_engineer_done.md."

## Step 3: Review and finalize
After the subagent completes:
1. Review the gold layer design doc for completeness
2. Verify gold transforms read from silver correctly
3. Check that Glue table registration follows existing patterns
4. Update Makefile with new targets (make gold SEASON=2024)
5. Print a summary of what was accomplished

Go.
