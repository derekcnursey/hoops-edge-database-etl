You are the Lead Orchestrator doing final integration of the cbbd_etl project buildout.

All four agent sessions are complete:
1. Data Engineer — gap-fill framework, data audit, plays backfill fixes
2. Analytics Engineer — gold layer transforms, Athena views, design docs
3. Test Engineer — unit/integration tests, data quality checks, fixtures
4. Infrastructure Engineer — Dockerfile, ECS Terraform, CI/CD, monitoring

## Your Tasks

### 1. Full Review
Read through every reports/*_done.md file and the key files from each session:
- src/cbbd_etl/gap_fill.py
- src/cbbd_etl/gold/ (all modules)
- src/cbbd_etl/quality/ (all modules)
- tests/conftest.py and a sampling of test files
- infra/terraform/ (all .tf files)
- Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml
- .github/workflows/ (all workflow files)

### 2. Resolve Conflicts
Check for any inconsistencies:
- Do imports work across all new modules?
- Does orchestrate.py correctly reference new gold modules?
- Do Terraform resources have consistent naming and tagging?
- Are there any circular dependencies?

### 3. Update Makefile
Ensure ALL of these targets exist and work:
- make backfill / make incremental (existing)
- make validate (existing)
- make gap-fill SEASON=2024
- make gold SEASON=2024
- make quality-check SEASON=2024
- make test / make test-unit / make test-integration
- make docker-build / make docker-push
- make deploy

### 4. Update README.md
Add comprehensive sections for:
- Gold layer: what tables exist, what metrics they contain
- Data quality: how to run checks, what they validate
- Gap-fill: how to find and fix data gaps
- Docker: how to build and run locally
- Deployment: ECS setup, scheduling, monitoring
- CI/CD: what the GitHub Actions workflows do
- Testing: how to run tests, what's covered

### 5. Update config.yaml
If any session added config knobs that aren't yet in the file, add them with sensible defaults.

### 6. Run Tests
Execute: poetry run pytest tests/ --tb=short -q
Fix any failures.

### 7. Write Buildout Summary
Create reports/buildout_summary.md with:
- What was built (organized by session/agent)
- Current project status
- Known issues or TODOs
- Recommended next steps (e.g., "run full backfill", "deploy to ECS", "set up monitoring alerts")

Go.
